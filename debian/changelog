ros-indigo-motoman-sia20d-support (0.3.6-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * sia20: add 'base' coordinate frame to xacro. For #45 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/45>.
    This corresponds to the Motoman 'Robot Frame' (not the 'Base Frame'). This
    frame has its origin at the intersection of the S axis and a horizontal
    plane going through the L axis.
  * Fix for issue #106 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/106>: use full-precision PI for tool0 transform (#110 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/110>)
    * sia10f: don't round PI in joint_t-tool0 transform.
    Leads to incorrect 'base->tool0' transform orientations.
    * sia20: don't round PI in joint_t-tool0 transform. Fix #106 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/106>.
    Leads to incorrect 'base->tool0' transform orientations.
  * Fix for issue #102 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/102>: fix incorrect joint limits in SIA20 urdf/xacro (#109 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/109>)
    * sia20d: fix joint limits S, R & T. Fix #102 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/102>.
    This floors PI, instead of rounding. This makes the joint limits slightly
    stricter than what is specced, but will avoid OOB errors on the controller.
    * sia20d: make all joint limits correspond to specsheet.
    All values truncated after the 4th digit.
