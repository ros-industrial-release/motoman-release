ros-indigo-motoman-sia10d-support (0.3.6-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * sia10: add 'base' coordinate frame to xacro. For #45 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/45>.
    This corresponds to the Motoman 'Robot Frame' (not the 'Base Frame'). This
    frame has its origin at the intersection of the S axis and a horizontal
    plane going through the L axis.
    Note: the frame was added manually to the urdf, so the '.urdf' is still out
    of sync with the xacro macro (issue #107 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/107>).
  * Fix for issue #104 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/104>: fix incorrect joint limits in SIA10 urdf/xacro (#108 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/108>)
    * sia10: fix joint limits S, R & T. Fix #104 <https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/issues/104>.
    This floors PI, instead of rounding. This makes the joint limits slightly
    stricter than what is specced, but will avoid OOB errors on the controller.
    * sia10: make all joint limits correspond to specsheet.
    All values truncated after the 4th digit.
